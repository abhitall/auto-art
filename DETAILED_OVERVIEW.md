## How to Extend the Framework

1. **Adding New Attacks**:
   - Create a new file in `auto_art/core/evaluation/attacks/`.
   - Implement the attack logic by extending the base attack class.

2. **Adding New Metrics**:
   - Add a new file in `auto_art/core/evaluation/metrics/`.
   - Implement the metric calculation logic.

3. **Adding New Models**:
   - Add a new file in `auto_art/implementations/models/`.
   - Implement the model-specific logic.

## Example Workflow

1. Load a model using the `models` module.
2. Configure attacks using the `attacks` module.
3. Evaluate the model using the `evaluation` module.
4. Log results using the `utils/logging` module.

## Conclusion

The Auto-ART framework is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to add new features and adapt to different use cases. For more details, refer to the source code and unit tests.

## Detailed File Explanations

### `auto_art/core`

#### `base.py`
This file contains foundational classes and utilities that other modules build upon. It includes:
- **BaseAttack**: A parent class for all attack implementations, providing common methods and attributes.

#### `evaluator.py`
Implements the main evaluation logic for adversarial robustness. Key components include:
- **ArtEvaluator**: A class that orchestrates the evaluation process by applying attacks and collecting metrics.
- **EvaluationPipeline**: A utility for chaining multiple evaluation steps.

#### `interfaces.py`
Defines interfaces to ensure consistency and extensibility. Key interfaces include:
- **AttackInterface**: Specifies the methods that all attack classes must implement.
- **EvaluatorInterface**: Defines the structure for evaluation modules.

### `auto_art/core/evaluation`

#### `attacks/`
